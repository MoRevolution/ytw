# YouTube Wrapped üé•

Our attempt at creating a YouTube dashboard that's cooler than your average analytics page. Think Spotify Wrapped, but for your YouTube addiction.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This project is still in its "we're figuring shit out" phase. Expect bugs, unexpected behavior, and maybe even some magic‚ú® (seriously we have no clue if we did auth right)

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` (or your preferred package manager)
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
5. ???
6. Profit (or at least have fun)

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (cause free hosting)
- TypeScript (zero clue why till now since JS technically has types??)
- Tailwind CSS (because...ya)
- YouTube Data API + Upstash (because we like YouTube)
- Firebase for Auth
